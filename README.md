# Search engines

## Google Dorks and Search Engine operators

- `site:website.com` get results from a specific website
- `AND` using `keyword AND otherkeyword` will get results that have both the keywords
- `"keyword otherkeyword"` will give results with this formulation in this order
- `OR` using `keyword OR otherkeyword` will get results that have either these keywords
- We can use wildcard with `*`
- `filetype:pdf` will give results according to the filetype mentionned here for instance we will get only pdf results
- `-subdomain` will remove a specific subdomain from the search results example: `site:website.com -www`
  - Can work with any other keyword that we do not want in the search results `-keyword`
- `intext:keyword` get results with the keyword in the text
- `inurl:keyword` look for url with a specific keyword in them
- `intitle:keyword` look for title with a specific keyword in the title

# What to do with a picture

## Reverse Image Searching

- Pretty straightforward we can use this link to do reverse Image searching, you just need to upload the image you are looking for information about
  - [Google Image Search](https://images.google.com)
  - [TinEye](https://tineye.com)  
  - [Yandex](https://yandex.com/)

## Get EXIF Data

Photo have data that is tied to the device and owner of the device

### How to get this data

Using the website Jeffrey's Image Metadata Viewer (see resources) we can extract this information. This contains the device info and geolocalisation.

## Physical Location

- Using the address a customer gave us for a physical pentest mandate, we can enter it in google map and have a look at the sattelite view and street:
  - Does it have any protection
  - Where to park without looking suspicious
  - Is the entree guarded
  - Is there a smoke area (useful for social engineering)
  - Could you tailgate your way in?

## Identifying Geographical Locations

Let's say we have an image
- If there is a car: 
  - where is it parked, 
  - what brand is it, 
  - What info get we get from the license plate, 
- How is the weather
  - Is it snowing?
- Architecture around 
- Street signs

# Discovering Email Addresses

## Lookup using websites

- [Hunter](https://hunter.io/) 50 free searches/month
We can use this tool to look for email address with a company name for instance. It is also useful to identify patterns on how the email address are built.
- [Phonebook](https://phonebook.cz/)
- [Voil√† Norbert](https://www.voilanorbert.com/)
- [Clearbit connect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clearbit-connect-supercha/pmnhcgfcafcnkbengdcanjablaabjplo?hl=en) need to be added on google chrome, but very powerful. Lots of filters, returns lots of info as well,..

## Methodology

- Look on google "who is in this role at this company" for example
- Then we can use phonebook or hunter and try to find the email pattern
- Then we can take the email and verify it with [emailhippo](https://tools.emailhippo.com/) or [emailchecker](https://email-checker.net/)

## Other tips

- We can use password recovery or account recovery to get more info about the user


# OSINT Password

## Hunting Breached password

- We can use [dehashed](https://dehashed.com/) **cost money**
  - If a similar password pops multiple times it means it could be used somewhere else.
  - Dehashed will also allow us to lookup for password and give information on where it is coming from
- [WeLeakInfo](https://weleakinfo.to/)
- [Snusbase](https://snusbase.com/)
- [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
- [Scylla](https://scylla.so/)

## Breachparse

- Get the tool [here](https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse)
- This tool will searched through the breach data and pull down names
- `./breach-parse.sh @domain.com outfile.txt` gather breached emails and passwords from the mentionned domain and put it in a file using the name mentioned
- At the end of the execution we will get 3 files `outfile-master.txt` with email and passwords, `outfile-passwords.txt` with the pulled passwords nd `outfile-users.txt` with the users

## Other tips

- If we get hash:
  - We can try to crack it
  - It can be useful to search it and see if it ties back to something else 
- Developers often share whole sections of code on StackOverflow  (we could find leaks there)
- Github migh have private keys or secret as well


# OSINT usernames

## Identify Website technology

- [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/) identify website technology
- [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/) browser add on to identify website technology

## Hunting down subdomains

- With google we can look for a specific website using `site:name` and add `inurl:admin` or `inurl:dev` we can also remove subdomain with `-www`
- [Pentest-Tools Subdomain Finder](https://pentest-tools.com/information-gathering/find-subdomains-of-domain#)
- [Spyse](https://spyse.com/)
- [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/) we can use a wildcard to search for example `%.domain.com`
  - `curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq .` output results in json
  - `curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq . | grep name | cut -d":" -f2 | grep -v "CN=" | cut -d'"' -f2 | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n");}1;' | sort -u` remove duplicates
  - `for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done`
- `dig any inlanefreight.com`
  - **A records**: We recognize the IP addresses that point to a specific (sub)domain through the A record. Here we only see one that we already know.
  - **MX records**: The mail server records show us which mail server is responsible for managing the emails for the company. Since this is handled by google in our case, we should note this and skip it for now.
  - **NS records**: These kinds of records show which name servers are used to resolve the FQDN to IP addresses. Most hosting providers use their own name servers, making it easier to identify the hosting provider.
  - **TXT records**: this type of record often contains verification keys for different third-party providers and other security aspects of DNS, such as SPF, DMARC, and DKIM, which are responsible for verifying and confirming the origin of the emails sent. Here we can already see some valuable information if we look closer at the results.

## Must to use tools

- [Shodan](https://shodan.io) we can use dorks to filter our search with words like `city:` `port:` `org:`
  - `for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f4 >> ip-addresses.txt;done` generate a list of IP addresses
  - `for i in $(cat ip-addresses.txt);do shodan host $i;done` run the list through Shodan.
- [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/)

## Methodology for subdomain enum

- We look up with the tools if we can find subdomains
- We check if they are alive with a tool like httpprobe
- We check the subdomains to see what we can do, we can use a tool like Photon that will make screenshot of the list of active subdomains found. This will make our work faster.

## Automate subdomain enumeration

- We can use this code. It was made by Heath Adams on his OSINT course in TCM Security Academy. You can check out this course [here](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/osint-fundamentals)
- It will see whois, find subdomains. Once it finds subdomain it is going to check if the subdomains are alive and then it will screenshot the subdomains that are alive.
- It will use automated tools (subfinder, assetfinder, amass, httprobe) that you can find info
- We can make it better and more suited to our needs, like adding other subdomain enum tools, etc..
- There is also a tool called Photon that we can use for similar purposes

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# We want the first argument to be a domain it will be launch like this ./script domain.com
domain=$1
RED="\033[1;31m"
RESET="\033[0m"

info_path=$domain/info
subdomain_path=$domain/subdomains
screenshot_path=$domain/screenshots

# will create all necessary folder for our findings
if [ ! -d "$domain" ];then
    mkdir $domain
fi

if [ ! -d "$info_path" ];then
    mkdir $info_path
fi

if [ ! -d "$subdomain_path" ];then
    mkdir $subdomain_path
fi

if [ ! -d "$screenshot_path" ];then
    mkdir $screenshot_path
fi

echo -e "${RED} [+] Checkin' who it is...${RESET}"
whois $1 > $info_path/whois.txt

echo -e "${RED} [+] Launching subfinder...${RESET}"
subfinder -d $domain > $subdomain_path/found.txt

echo -e "${RED} [+] Running assetfinder...${RESET}"
assetfinder $domain | grep $domain >> $subdomain_path/found.txt

#echo -e "${RED} [+] Running Amass. This could take a while...${RESET}"
#amass enum -d $domain >> $subdomain_path/found.txt

echo -e "${RED} [+] Checking what's alive...${RESET}"
cat $subdomain_path/found.txt | grep $domain | sort -u | httprobe -prefer-https | grep https | sed 's/https\?:\/\///' | tee -a $subdomain_path/alive.txt

echo -e "${RED} [+] Taking dem screenshotz...${RESET}"
gowitness file -f $subdomain_path/alive.txt -P $screenshot_path/ --no-http
```

- We can start the "tracking" and add it to a specific case
- We can highlight keywords, take notes on website
- It will record everything viewed



 # Write an OSINT report

- It has to be very detailed so that the person you will hand the report will be able to reproduce what you did.

## Summary

- We remind here the goals and who mandate us to do what


## Key findinds

- We can sum up here some key high level findings found during the assement (usernames, phone numbers etc.)

## Technical evidence

- Step by step what has been done to find something
- Each technical evidence can be a step.
- We can make it look like a table like this:  

|OSINT| Osint Action done for example username found on websites|
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------|
|Link| link or reference to the used technology|
|notes|explanations and details|

- Then we can add a visual evidence
